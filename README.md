This is a repository storing the code written during my final year Physics MSci project, "Electrofreezing of Supercooled Water". 

Specifically, the program has been written to simulate a cluster gas under the influence of an external electric field. The rate at which clusters grow or shrink is anticipated to change due to the field-dependent nature of the parameters on which the rate equations depend.
